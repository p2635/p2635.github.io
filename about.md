At work, I am a QA newibie working at [WEGIT](https://www.wegit.co.uk/) in the UK. At the moment, I mainly do manual testing and use collaborative tools like JIRA and Slack to talk to the team and get things done. Eventually I want to learn more about test automation (Gherkin, Behat etc.)

In my free time, I like to study Japanese. For exercise, I don't.
