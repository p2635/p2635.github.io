我今日開始了這個[#30DaysOfSecurityTesting的挑戰](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-security-testing)。我第一天就已經遇到困難，我的Day 1不知道應該看什麼blog才好。由於我最近才開始QA的工作，我是一個初學者所以我還有很多的不懂。幸好MoT(Ministry of Testing)有一個Slack group，我加入了就有很多樂意恊助我的伙伴。我今天看的blog就是[這個傢伙](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/mirai-co-author-gets-6-months-confinement-8-6m-in-fines-for-rutgers-attacks/)，聰明人為何惹麻煩呢?有智慧居然搞DDoS不好好學習，何必?

Today I started the [#30DaysOfSecurityTesting challenge](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-security-testing). I'm already stuck on my first day, I don't know what to read for my day 1. As I just started in QA, I'm still a newbie so there is a lot I don't know. Luckily MoT (Ministry of Testing) has a Slack group, lots of people are willing to help me once I joined. Today I read about [this fellow](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/mirai-co-author-gets-6-months-confinement-8-6m-in-fines-for-rutgers-attacks/), clever boy why do you have to get in trouble? Why don't you just save your intelligence for your studies?
